# Setup

Steps here touch your own accounts/secrets, so they're written as commands for you to run rather than something done on your behalf. None of this is needed to build/run the current app shell - only for the phases that need signing, push, or CI publishing.

## 1. Release signing keystore (needed from Phase 4 onward)

Generate it locally, keep it outside the repo (`.gitignore` already excludes `*.jks`/`*.keystore`):

```
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore release.jks -alias manager-release -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000
```

Pick your own store/key passwords when prompted - don't reuse them elsewhere. Back the file up somewhere offline (per [spec section 20](spec/master-specification.md#20-apk-signing-strategy)); losing it means you can never publish an update under the same signing identity again.

Base64-encode it for CI:

```
base64 -w0 release.jks > release.jks.b64
```

Add as GitHub Actions secrets (repo Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions), or via `gh`:

```
gh secret set RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64 < release.jks.b64
gh secret set RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
gh secret set RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
gh secret set RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
```

Delete `release.jks.b64` locally once uploaded.

## 2. Firebase project (needed from Phase 9, FCM)

1. Create a project at https://console.firebase.google.com (free Spark plan - FCM has no usage cap on it).
2. Add an Android app with package name `dev.cl0ud9.manager`.
3. Download `google-services.json`, place it at `app/google-services.json`. It's gitignored - each environment (your machine, CI) needs its own copy or a secret-backed copy.
4. For CI, base64-encode it the same way as the keystore and store as `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON_BASE64`; the workflow decodes it before build.

## 3. Manifest signing key (needed from Phase 2, per amendment 44.3)

```
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out manifest-signing.key
openssl pkey -in manifest-signing.key -pubout -out manifest-signing.pub
```

Keep `manifest-signing.key` as a CI secret (`MANIFEST_SIGNING_KEY`), never commit it. The public key (`manifest-signing.pub`) gets baked into the app as a resource - that one's fine to commit once Phase 2 wires it in.

## 4. GitHub access token (needed to install the YouTube ReVanced catalog entry)

Its build is published as a private draft release (see `revanced/README.md` for why), so the app
needs an authenticated request to fetch it - a plain download URL won't work for a draft asset.
Create a fine-grained personal access token scoped to just this repo with read-only "Contents"
access (github.com -> Settings -> Developer settings -> Fine-grained tokens), then paste it into
the app's own Settings > GitHub access. This is a per-installer credential entered in the app
itself, not a CI secret - skip this section entirely if you don't plan to install that entry.

## 5. ReVanced signing keystore (needed for `.github/workflows/revanced-youtube.yml`)

Reuses your own ReVanced Manager keystore rather than minting a new one, so anything this pipeline
signs stays update-compatible with anything you've already installed through ReVanced Manager
itself. Export it from the ReVanced Manager app (Settings -> Import & export -> Keystore ->
Export), note its alias and both passwords from the same screen, then:

```
base64 -w0 revanced-manager.keystore > revanced-manager.keystore.b64
gh secret set REVANCED_KEYSTORE_BASE64 < revanced-manager.keystore.b64
gh secret set REVANCED_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
gh secret set REVANCED_KEY_ALIAS
gh secret set REVANCED_KEY_PASSWORD
```

Delete `revanced-manager.keystore.b64` locally once uploaded.

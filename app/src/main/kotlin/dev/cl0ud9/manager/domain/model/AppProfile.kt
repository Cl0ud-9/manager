// one downloadable build of an app, section 9 of the spec - AppProfile.artifacts holds every
// build currently retained that fits this device (newest first), not just the latest, so a broken
// newest build still leaves older ones installable
// requiresAuth is true only for artifacts hosted as a private GitHub release asset (the
// ReVanced-style apps, kept off public releases) - downloadUrl is then a
// api.github.com/repos/.../releases/assets/{id} URL rather than a plain browser_download_url, and
// needs a bearer token the download engine reads from GitHubCredentialStore
// patchesVersionName is the version of the *tool* that built this artifact (e.g. the ReVanced
// patches bundle), distinct from versionName (the app's own version, e.g. YouTube's) - null for
// artifacts with no such intermediate build tool
// buildId tells apart two builds of the same versionName (a ReVanced rebuild with newer patches
// keeps YouTube's own version), and is null only in manifests older than schema 2

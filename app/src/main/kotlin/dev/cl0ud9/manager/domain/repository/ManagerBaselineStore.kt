// installs its own beta build, for example) - before this app ever recorded anything for it. If the

// live version is exactly what we don't trust, so the guess comes from the catalog's OWN memory
// instead: the newest build it had already published when the installed one appeared (its
// lastUpdateTime), else the oldest build it still retains. Deliberately not persisted - it's cheap
// to recompute, and persisting it would lock in a guess instead of a fact the moment a real
